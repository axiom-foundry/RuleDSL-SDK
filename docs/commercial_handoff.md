# Commercial Handoff Checklist

This document is an operational checklist for moving from evaluation to paid deployment.
It is not a legal contract.

## A) Inputs from Evaluation Close-out

Before commercial handoff, confirm:

- Evaluation success criteria are met (see `docs/evaluation_playbook.md`).
- Artifact hashes are recorded for evaluated binaries and bytecode.
- Environment summary is recorded (OS, architecture, toolchain/runtime details).
- Rollback drill is completed and verified.

## B) What Vendor Provides at Purchase Time (Operational)

- Delivery of versioned artifact set as defined in `docs/distribution.md`.
- Support contact endpoints populated through onboarding channels.
- Support tier selection documented if applicable (no pricing defined here).

## C) What Customer Confirms

- Target deployment environment is within supported scope.
- Compatibility window is understood (`docs/version_policy.md`).
- Incident bundle process is adopted (`docs/evaluation_playbook.md` and `docs/support_policy.md`).

## D) References

- `docs/evaluation_playbook.md`
- `docs/distribution.md`
- `docs/support_policy.md`
