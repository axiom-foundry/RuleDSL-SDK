This document is a placeholder in the public SDK.

String literal lexing rules are currently defined in existing language specification files:
- [lexical_core_v0_9.md](lexical_core_v0_9.md)
- [spec_v0_9.md](spec_v0_9.md)

Related syntax context is defined in:
- [grammar_v0_9.md](grammar_v0_9.md)

This placeholder keeps cross-references stable for public readers.
A dedicated string-lexing annex may be published later.
